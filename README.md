# cs189 project Week 7: Bagging


<b>Navigating the file:</b>  
This repo will help students wil prior experience with EE16A, EE16B, CS61B to learn the concept of bagging. 
As a student, you will first read through the notes and gain a theoretical knowledge of bagging related concepts. Then, you can take a quick quiz to check your basic understanding of the key concepts. The slide deck will also help you gain an overarching understanding of the material. The coding assignment is for you to get your hands dirty. You will implement naive polynomial regression bagging to more sophisticated random forest.  

<b>Learning Objective</b> 
At the conclusion of the aforementioned exercise, students should develop their own mindmap of bagging related concepts.  
Students should be able to answer the three W questions on the high level: 1) what is bagging 2) why bagging 3) when to use bagging.  
Student should feel comfortable applying theoretical knowledge to code and learn to get relevant functions from machine learning libraries.
